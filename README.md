# YouGIF
YouGIF takes a YouTube video URL input and converts it into a frame-by-frame editable gif. It was designed by me and Winston Lee at the Fall 2012 UC Berkeley hackathon hosted by IEEE and Hackers@Berkeley, and placed 3rd!

## Dependencies
YouGIF is built on Flask, a lightweight Python web development framework. It requires youtube-dl, ffmpeg, imagemagick, and the Python Image Library as dependencies. (Tip: Installing these is much easier if you have Homebrew!)
