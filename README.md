# YouGIF
YouGIF takes a YouTube video URL input and converts it into a frame-by-frame editable gif. It was designed by me and [Winston Lee](http://github.com/winst) at the Fall 2012 UC Berkeley hackathon hosted by IEEE and Hackers@Berkeley, and placed 3rd!

## Dependencies
YouGIF is built on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a lightweight Python web development framework. It requires [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/), [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), and the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) as dependencies. (Tip: Installing these dependencies is much easier if you have [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)!)
